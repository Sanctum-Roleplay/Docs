# EMS Ranking Structure


#### **EMT Basic**

This basic level of emergency responder can provide immediate and basic lifesaving care and first aid, but typically must wait for higher-level EMTs or paramedics to perform any more advanced care. They are likely to be partnered with EMTs or paramedics to provide assistance rather than working alone. An EMT Basic may also drive the ambulance and assist with transporting of patients.

#### **EMT Intermediate**

An intermediate EMT is trained to administer more advanced medical care than an EMT at the basic level. This may include training to assess the state of patient, more advanced airway procedures and devices, the use of a defibrillator to resuscitate patients, and the administration of some medications, including supplemental oxygen.
