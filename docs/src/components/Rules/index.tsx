              Please refrain from playing &quot;money simulator&quot;. This can

              Cop baiting is a great form of LQRP. This is where you
              purposefully attempt to bait Police Officers into a scenario
              without any RP behind it. Ex. Hitting a cop car to have them chase
              you to an ambush.{" "}

              Strictly no salty and toxic behavior. Examples include repeated
              mag dumping into a downed body, playing loud music, screaming over
              the microphone, spitting and emoting on downed bodies,
              &quot;Spinning till they don&#39;t wake up&quot; and Twitter
              drama.

            <li>
              No hospital camping to rub salt in the wounds if you win or lose a

            </li>
            <li>
              Scenes are to be used to enhance RP by giving context to a scene,

              Players can be identified by their face, outfit, or individual

              Stripping off clothing items after a crime or other interaction
              can still warrant a detainment by Police for questioning if they
              have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that you were involved
              in a crime or other event. We recommend changing your entire
              outfit before and after a crime and refraining from wearing gang
              colors during a crime as that would implicate the entire group.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Description: You must value your life similar to the way you
                  do your own life in real life. For example, you must not
                  engage in a gunfight for the fun of it, knowing that you would
                  not do it IRL. At all times you must value your life as if it
                  were your last. If you are at a clear disadvantage, for
                  example, a gun pointed at the back of your head whilst you are
                  looking in the other direction, you must comply with their
                  demands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are outnumbered 3 to 1 you must comply. This does not
                  mean that you do not have the option to try and escape. When
                  possible and in a correction situation, you have the option to
                  try and escape.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bad example of an attempt to escape is if are being held
                  hostage in front of a bank and decide to run away even though
                  the person has a firearm ready.

              New Life Rule: Triggered once you are incapacitated and respawn at
              the hospital. The cause of death is irrelevant, Getting yourself
              downed is not considered as dying, therefore once you get treaded
              by EMS, the new life rule is not triggered. You lose all memory
              from the scenario if you respawn by using &quot;E&quot;
            </li>
            <li>
              After you are incapacitated, not downed, you cannot talk about
              your death through in-character channels unless an
              individual/party informs you through RP. ( Make sure to have it
              clipped. )
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a player becomes incapacitated, they cannot come back to the
              area of their death for 30 minutes, and they cannot take hostile
              action against the party responsible for their death for 60
              minutes. They also lose every rp reason to take hostile action
              against the party responsible for their death.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you leave a scenario, and it has ended, then you are not
              allowed to return to the area of the scene to collect evidence,
              loot bodies, etc.

            <li>
              Another player is not able to decide when another pk&#39;s their

              commence with the scenario. You are allowed to plan out a scenario
              OOC if you decide on permaing your character. Your character can
              not just randomly be deleted without reasoning.

                  RDM is not allowed by any means, In short, RDM is the act of
                  killing or hurting another player or damaging their property
                  intentionally by the use of any force without having a valid
                  in-character reason to do that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are allowed to attack another player if they try to hurt
                  you or damage your property intentionally, if they ignore your
                  threats and attempt to resist or if they try to take hostile

                <li>
                  <strong>Examples</strong>: 1) Someone talked trash towards
                  you, so you withdraw a firearm and shoot them. That is RDM. 2)
                  You provoke a fist fight then proceed to pull out a firearm

                  their property intentionally by using a vehicle without having
                  a valid in-character reason to do that. Intentionally running
                  over another individual with a valid in-character reason can
                  still be considered LQRP.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Examples</strong>: 1) Someone insulted you, so you ran

                  them with your vehicle multiple times 3) Someone robbed you
