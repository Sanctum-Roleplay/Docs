<p>PREAMBLE: Policy and Guidelines</p>
<p>Purpose</p>

<p>For consistency and to allow ease of understanding, please refer to penal code entries in one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the full title, underlined, prefix first. For example, (1)01. Criminal Threats or (10)01. Drivers Licenses</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Title 1.Crimes Against The Person</strong></p>
<p>(1)01. Criminal Threats</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who communicates to another that they will physically harm or kill such other, placing such other in a reasonable state of fear for their own safety is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>A person who communicates that they will physically harm or kill another person’s close friends or relatives is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>Such communication can be not just verbal, but also in writing or transmitted through other media is guilty under this code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Criminal Threats differs from assault in terms of the distance between the acts. Criminal Threats can occur across the street, while assault is up close, within reach of leading to battery.</p>
<p>(1)02. Assault</p>
<p>A person who intentionally puts another in the reasonable belief of imminent physical harm or offensive contact is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>1. Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.</p>
<p>NOTES :</p>
<p>Assault is defined by distance the threats occur. Someone a few feet away threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Criminal Threats is less severe as there’s a distance that someone can escape through, or that the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat.</p>
<p>Any unwanted physical contact is considered to be battery, however grabbing someone during a threat may be either assault or battery, depending on intention and interpretation.</p>
<p>(1)03. Assault With A Deadly Weapon</p>
<p>A person who attempts to cause or threaten immediate harm to another while using a weapon, tool, or other dangerous item to communicate that threat is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>1. Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Assault With A Deadly Weapon matches the description of Assault, but the perpetrator also has a weapon or tool being used to communicate or facilitate that violence or fear. See Assault for additional notes. Any act of Criminal Threats with a weapon is considered Assault With a Deadly Weapon, but the weapon must be visibly seen for this to count.</p>
<p>(1)04. Battery</p>
<p>A person who uses intentional and unlawful force or violence to cause physical harm to another person is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Battery is defined as the moment aggressive physical contact occurs. The first punch or two would be Battery. To keep punching and fighting extensively afterward is Aggravated Battery.</p>
<p>Grabbing someone may be either assault or battery, depending on the circumstances. Discharging bodily fluids onto another without their consent is considered battery.</p>
<p>(1)05. Aggravated Battery</p>
<p>A person who commits battery and serious bodily injury is inflicted on the person is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>1. Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.</p>
<p>NOTES :</p>
<p>Aggravated Battery is the continued violence or battery against an individual, such as an ongoing fight or brawl, that doesn’t lead to severe bodily harm or life threatening injury.</p>
<p>(1)06. Attempted Murder</p>
<p>A person who takes a direct step towards killing another person and intended to kill that person is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>(1)07. Manslaughter</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who unintentionally kills another, with or without a quarrel or heat of passion is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>A person who, through a criminal accident or negligence, causes someone&#x27;s death is guilty under this code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Manslaughter is homicide that is not premeditated or proven to have intent or an opportunity to pause and reflect on killing that person. An opportunity to reflect (and therefore possibly change your mind) demonstrates premeditation and is murder. Manslaughter is only charged in the penal code when some sort of criminal negligence or action can be proven. Killing someone while driving drunk is manslaughter.</p>
<p>(1)08. Murder</p>
<p>A person who unlawfully kills another with malice aforethought is guilty under this code section.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.</li>
</ol>
<p>A person who commits murder while engaging in a felony offense that has been proven to be a premeditated act is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Murder is defined clearly by a person’s premeditated forethought or plan to commit the murder. Manslaughter happens in a heat of passion, by criminal negligence or accident, or for some other incident that is not expected. The only exception to this is when someone commits a planned felony, such as planning to commit an arson. If someone dies as a result of the premeditated arson, it is no longer manslaughter and instead murder. Murder of an “NPC” will be charged as (1)7.</p>
<p>(1)09. False Imprisonment</p>
<p>A person who intentionally and unlawfully restrained, detained, or confined a person and made the person stay or go somewhere against his or her will is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>(1)10. Kidnapping</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who forcibly, or by any other means of instilling fear, steals, takes, holds, detains, or arrests any person is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>A person who commits false imprisonment for the purpose of protection of arrest is guilty under this code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.1 Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Kidnapping is generally the taking of a person with force or violence. Note the use of the term “arrests” should not be taken to mean that an improper attempt at a citizens arrest is a kidnapping. The taking of a hostage to prevent one&#x27;s arrest also qualifies as kidnapping regardless of the use of violence.</p>
<p>(1)11. Torture</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who intentionally causes extreme pain and suffering to someone is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>A person who causes pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose is guilty under this code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1)12. Domestic Violation</p>
<ul>
<li>When a battery is committed against a spouse, a person with whom the defendant is cohabiting, a person who is the parent of the defendant’s child, former spouse, fiancé, or fiancée, or a person with whom the defendant currently has, or has previously had, a dating or engagement relationship.</li>
<li>Any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a victim described is guilty of a felony.</li>
<li>Penal Code (1)12.1 is a misdemeanor punishable by 12 months in county jail.</li>
<li>Penal Code (1)12.2 is a felony punishable by 20 months in prison.</li>
</ul>
<p>(1)13. Vehicular Manslaughter</p>
<ul>
<li>A person who unintentionally kills another, while operating a motor vehicle is guilty under this code section.</li>
<li>A person who, through a criminal accident or negligence, causes someone&#x27;s death by motor vehicle impact is guilty under this code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Manslaughter is homicide that is not premeditated or proven to have intent or an opportunity to pause and reflect on killing that person. An opportunity to reflect (and therefore possibly change your mind) demonstrates premeditation and is murder. Manslaughter is only charged in the penal code when some sort of criminal negligence or action can be proven. Killing someone while driving drunk is manslaughter.</p>
<p>(1)14. Hostage Taking</p>
<p>A person committed (1)09 and endangered that person as a hostage is guilty under this code section.</p>
<p>(1)15. Assault on LEO</p>
<p>A person who attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to any LEO in the performance of duty can be charged with aggravated assault.</p>
<p>(1)16. Assault w/ Deadly Weapon on LEO</p>
<p>Assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer (LEO) is a criminal offense in which an individual threatens or attempts to cause bodily injury to a law enforcement officer using a weapon capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.</p>
<p>(1)17. Attempted Murder on LEO</p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>The need for correctional services to have prisoner’s to RP with;</li>
<li>The need for non correctional services LEOs to have civilians to interact with; and</li>
<li>The need for civilians to have a fair and balanced punishment system.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When correctional services is active the following 2 pieces of information shall be determined on a regular basis:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The number of active correctional services personnel working at the prison</li>
<li>Members who are transporting prisoners are considered to be working at the prison.</li>
<li>The ratio of LEO members + Fire members to Civilians</li>
<li>Mathematically this is (LEO + Fire) / Civilians</li>
<li>For example if there are 5 total LEOs, 5 Fire, and 5 Civs the calculation is (5+5)/5 or 2.</li>
<li>This is referred to as a civ ratio below.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Based on the information determined in element 2 correctional services will operation in one of the following modes:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mode 1: Active correctional services members under 3 and civ ratio is over 3.</li>
<li>Mode 2: Active correctional services members at or over 3 or civ ratio is at or under 3.</li>

<p>Example: A prisoner convicted of murder would serve the following sentences based on the prison mode:</p>
<p>Mode 1: 600 months (10 minutes)</p>
<p>Mode 2: 1200 months (20 minutes)</p>
<p>Mode 3: 1800 months (30 minutes)</p>

<ol>
<li>The prison is operating in mode 1 or mode 2</li>
<li>Transport time takes over 5 minutes</li>
<li>Transport time starts at the point where a radio request for transport is made and ends when the prisoner reaches the prison</li>
