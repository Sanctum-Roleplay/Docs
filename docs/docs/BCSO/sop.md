## **4\. Disciplinary Policies and Procedures**

### **4.1 Process**

1. A complaint is submitted to a supervisor or a supervisor observes a violation.
2. An investigation is conducted if necessary, if not, proceed to step 5.
3. During an investigation all Officers involved with the violation should be questioned individually regarding what occurred and any body cam footage should be submitted for review.
4. If the reporting supervisor was directly involved with the violation they shall not conduct the investigation and it shall be handled by a separate supervisor.
5. If no investigation is required for the incident, the supervisor shall make a determination of whether the incident warrants formal disciplinary action or verbal counsel. If it is determined that no formal disciplinary action shall occur, this concludes the process. If formal disciplinary action is being taken, proceed to step 6.
6. Once a form of disciplinary action has been decided, the supervisor will draft a formal notice using the template provided and submit it to both the offending Officer and a supervisor that is capable of entering it into the logs.

Schedule 2's do not directly affect future promotions or special duty positions. These are typically issued for simple policy violation, such as being out of uniform.
2. Schedule 1 Written Reprimand This is very similar to schedule 2's with the only difference being that these are given for more severe offenses and/or having multiple schedule 2's for the same violation.

## **6\. Radio Communications**

### **6.1 Radio Etiquette**

1. The LSPD "City-Wide Dispatch" serves as the primary patrol frequency. It is used by patrol personnel to communicate directly with other personnel and other law enforcement agencies that are within the city. When the RTO is put in effect, proper radio etiquette is expected from all members. Failure to follow RTO rules will result in disciplinary action.
2. All radio communications begin with who you are reaching (ex: Dispatch \[from\] 101) then followed by the information that needs to be communicated. In the event the unit you are attempting to reach may be busy you can simply use the initial contact format then wait for that unit to say “go ahead” or something along those lines
3. To break a Radio Transmission for an emergency, use "BREAK BREAK BREAK"

### **6.2 Phonetic Alphabet**

:::info
Blaine County Sheriff Office Personnel at all times are required to use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet when relaying information over the radio. This ensures that dispatch can properly collect the plate information.

## **7\. Leave of Absence Policy**

### **7.1 Overview**

A leave of absence (LOA) is a period of time that one must be away from the server while maintaining the status of a member. Leave of absences are to be formally requested through means of a leave of absence form. Upon submission, the requesting party is to immediately inform their direct supervisor. Taking an LOA in response to disciplinary action is unacceptable behavior and will result in further disciplinary action. While on a leave of absence, members are exempt from all duties and associated requirements. A leave of absence may be requested at the discretion of the Officer, but is to be approved by their immediate supervisor.

## **8\. Pursuit Policy**

### **8.1 Overview**

:::warning
Effective immediately LSPD will conduct any and all vehicle pursuits based on the following guidelines
:::

1. At ANY time an on-duty shift supervisor can terminate ANY pursuit initiated by LSPD regular patrol personnel. Failure to terminate the pursuit when ordered by a supervisor will result in disciplinary action being taken.
2. Supervisors can and will request "Pursuit Conditions". At that time the initiating Officer is to give the following: Callsign, Road/Traffic Conditions, Speed, Reason of Pursuit.
3. LSPD Officers should exercise good judgment as to if the pursuit is worth it. Speeding 10 over the posted for example is not worthy of a pursuit that puts countless others at risk. On the other hand, if a subject is known to have Felony Warrants or have been confirmed to have been involved in a violent crime then they are pursuit worthy within reason.
4. LSPD Officers will no longer pursue every single vehicle. This has created countless hazardous situations without cause or reason and the fault is on the Officers involved for not exercising good judgment.
5. There will be a limit of 5 cars for a pursuit with the exception of an all call at the direction of the watch commander. Command members will also be exempt from this rule as well.
6. When a subject travels in oncoming lanes during a pursuit only the lead car will be permitted to follow. No other car shall go into oncoming lanes to pursue unless the offender foot bails or is pinned by the primary unit.
7. Officers will not overtake the vehicle in front of them in the order of the pursuit, without requesting to do such.
8. Officers will not engage in Pursuit Intervention Tactics (PIT) without authorization from either the secondary vehicle, active supervisor, or watch commander. Pursuit Intervention Tactics will only be authorized if conditions are clear, and will not present an immediate danger to the public, or Officers.
9. If and when a suspect takes a stunt jump, only the primary unit is allowed to follow. (This change excludes Command Staff and TEU Commander)
10. If and when a civilian steals a patrol vehicle, code black (lethal force) is authorized.

## **9\. Bodycam Guidelines**

### **9.1 Overview**

_While on duty and patrolling, Officers are required to have a working bodycam. The bodycam is to be used at all times while on-duty, failure to do so will result in disciplinary action._

1. The following interactions should always be captured by bodycam:

- Interactions with members of the public, especially when on-scene.
- Any disputes between Officers
- All interactions with government (staff)

1. The following is a list of recommended methods of using a bodycam, these are not required as you may use whatever method you find best for you and your PC so long as it works properly:

- OBS
- GeForce Experience (Nvidia)
- Medal
- Radeon Software (AMD)

## **10\. Use of Force**

### **10.1 Overview**

The intent of this policy is to define clearly, and definitively the use of force for the Blaine County Sheriff Office. We are all here to serve the citizens, free of abuse and tyranny. The use of force continuum can be broken down into two categories, escalation and de-escalation. The use of force continuum is a useful tool, but does not necessarily pertain to all situations. It is the responsibility of Officers to remain one level higher than the subject, for their safety, and the safety of the civilians around them. It is also the responsibility of Officers to utilize the correct amount of force required by the scenario. Once the scenario is over, and conditions are permissible, de-escalation techniques should be initiated, and first aid rendered.

All Officer Involved Shootings are to be recorded by bodycam or dashcam, and an IA ticket made within 12 hours after the conclusion of the scene. Due to the weight, and size of vehicles, ramming a person with your vehicle in a manner that is intended to cause bodily harm, is considered lethal force. All cases are not one size fits all, and are required to be reviewed by IA.

1. Officer Presence; this is considered the Professional category.
2. The presence of law enforcement in the area or on a scene can deter criminal behavior.
3. The civilians would be compliant in this phase.

2\. Communication; this is considered the Tactical category.

1. This category includes verbal commands and contact controls.
2. The subject would be cooperative and non-aggressive.

3\. Compliance Techniques; this is considered the Threshold category.

1. This category includes pain compliance, take downs, and chemical agents.
2. The subject would be standoffish, and non-compliant with verbal communication.

4\. Non-Lethals; this is considered the Harmful category.

1. This category includes impact weapons, electrical devices, baton strikes to the body, not the face and other tools that Officers may have available.
2. The subject would be non-compliant with compliance techniques, and actively assaulting you or someone else.

5\. Deadly Force; this is considered the Lethal category.

1. This category includes, but is not limited to, any service weapon being discharged towards any person.
2. This category also includes baton strikes, physical weapon strikes, or taser discharges towards any person's face, or above the neck region.
3. The subject in this category is combative, has a weapon and is presenting immediate danger to life and health of Law Enforcement Officers, or civilians.


## **11\. Take Home Guidelines**

### **11.1 Overview:**

The LSPD Command Staff, operators of Special Weapons and Tactics, and detectives of the Division of Criminal Investigations, may take one unmarked patrol vehicle with no extras and within their rank, as well as their service pistol. In case of any emergency, this policy allows those officers to respond almost immediately and without the trouble of going to the station first.
