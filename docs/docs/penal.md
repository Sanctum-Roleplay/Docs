1\. Enhancement for violation against a peace officer.

:::info
Assault is defined by distance the threats occur. Someone a few feet away threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Criminal Threats is less severe as there’s a distance that someone can escape through, or that the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat.

Any unwanted physical contact is considered to be battery, however grabbing someone during a threat may be either assault or battery, depending on intention and interpretation.
:::

#### **(1)03**. Assault With A Deadly Weapon

A person who attempts to cause or threaten immediate harm to another while using a weapon, tool, or other dangerous item to communicate that threat is guilty under this code section.

See Assault for additional notes. Any act of Criminal Threats with a weapon is considered Assault With a Deadly Weapon, but the weapon must be visibly seen for this to count.
:::

**(1)04**. Battery
