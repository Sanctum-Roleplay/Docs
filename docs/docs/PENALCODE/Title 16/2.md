# [16.2] Determination of Prison Mode - OOC

1. The intent of this section is to create a metric that can be used to balance the following 3 needs of the department

- The need for correctional services to have prisonerâ€™s to RP with;
- The need for non correctional services LEOs to have civilians to interact with; and
- The need for civilians to have a fair and balanced punishment system.

1. When correctional services is active the following 2 pieces of information shall be determined on a regular basis:

- The number of active correctional services personnel working at the prison
- Members who are transporting prisoners are considered to be working at the prison.
- The ratio of LEO members + Fire members to Civilians
- Mathematically this is (LEO + Fire) / Civilians
- For example if there are 5 total LEOs, 5 Fire, and 5 Civs the calculation is (5+5)/5 or 2.
- This is referred to as a civ ratio below.

1. Based on the information determined in element 2 correctional services will operation in one of the following modes:

- Mode 1: Active correctional services members under 3 and civ ratio is over 3.
- Mode 2: Active correctional services members at or over 3 or civ ratio is at or under 3.
- Mode 3: Active correctional services member at or over 3 and civ ratio is at or under 3.
