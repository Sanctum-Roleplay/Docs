# [8.11] Driving on the Right Side

- Upon all highways, a vehicle shall be driven upon the right half of the roadway or to the right of double solid parallel yellow lines, except as follows:
- Yellow markings do not prohibit a driver from crossing the marking if (1) turning to the left at an intersection or into or out of a driveway or private road, or (2) making a U-turn under the rules governing that turn
- When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction when such action can be taken without crossing a solid yellow or solid white line
- Upon a roadway restricted to one-way traffic.
- When the vehicle is necessarily traveling so slowly as to impede the normal movement of traffic, that portion of the road adjacent to the right edge of the roadway may be utilized temporarily when in a condition permitting safe operation.
- Whenever a road has been divided into two or more roadways by means of intermittent barriers or by means of a dividing section of not less than two feet in width, either unpaved or delineated by curbs, double-parallel lines, or other markings on the roadway, it is unlawful to do either of the following:
- To drive any vehicle over, upon, or across the dividing section.
- To make any left, semicircular, or U-turn with the vehicle on the divided highway, except through an opening in the barrier designated and intended by public authorities for the use of vehicles or through a plainly marked opening in the dividing section.
