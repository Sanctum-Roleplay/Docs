# [8.9] Traffic Signals - Responsibility at a Green Signal

- A driver facing a circular green signal shall proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-turn unless a sign prohibits a U-turn. Any driver, including one turning, shall yield the right-of-way to other traffic and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
- A driver facing a green signal shown immediately in front of a lane marked for a left or right turn shall enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by pavement markings or any other movement that is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. A driver permitted to make a left turn may also make a U-turn unless prohibited by a sign. A driver shall yield the right-of-way to other traffic and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
- A pedestrian facing a circular green signal, unless prohibited by sign or otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, but shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that signal is first shown.
