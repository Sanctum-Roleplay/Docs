# [8.10] Traffic Signals - Responsibility at a Red Signal

- A driver facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a marked limit line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain stopped until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided in element 2.
- Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, a driver, after stopping as required by element 1, facing a steady circular red signal, may turn right, or turn left from a one-way street onto a one-way street. A driver making that turn shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to any vehicle that has approached or is approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard to the driver, and shall continue to yield the right-of-way to that vehicle until the driver can proceed with reasonable safety.
    1. Indication to proceed, defined:
        1. When the driver has stopped for at least 2 seconds and no other traffic is present.
        2. When the driver has stopped and the lights on either side are also red.
        3. When the steady circular green signal is illuminated.
- A driver facing a steady red signal shown immediately in front of a lane marked for a left turn shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the pavement markings, and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked limit line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain stopped until an indication permitting movement is shown.
- Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal a pedestrian facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal shall not enter the roadway.
