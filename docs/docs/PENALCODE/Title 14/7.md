# [14.7] Officer Discretion

1. Law enforcement officers shall have the authority to use their discretion when issuing infractions or select misdemeanors. This discretion entitles the officer to choose to forego an infraction or misdemeanor penalty based on their personal judgment.
2. Officers may choose to issue Officer Discretion and forego charging, not issue a fine or other punishment in lieu of the typical punishment.
3. Officers cannot elect Officer Discretion if the independent victim, property owner, or affected party chooses to press charges on the perpetrator.
