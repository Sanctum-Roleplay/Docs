# [14.6] Suspicion Policy

1. A peace officer's justifiable suspicion of a person to commit or conspire to commit a crime is sufficient to allow that individual to be detained for questioning for no more than 30 minutes in police or court custody, however they cannot be searched beyond a legal Terry Frisk for the officerâ€™s safety unless probable cause or concurrent evidence emerges.
2. A person who is at the scene of a crime, riot, or major public disturbance may also be classified under the suspicion policy for temporary detainment.
3. Violation of this policy, or an act of justifiable suspicion that extends beyond legal bounds, extends beyond Color of Law and is satisfactory for suit.
