# [14.2] Private Defense, Self Defense, Castle Doctrine, And Defense Of Others

1. A person who has a reasonable belief that they, or another, are in imminent danger of a forcible felony being committed on them or a family member and they believe that imminent force is needed to prevent that danger and use no more force than is necessary to negate that danger shall be absolved of criminal liability in Title 1. Crimes Against the Person. ALL these requirements must be met to be completely absolved of criminal liability.
2. This also applies in the case of a person who is protecting their home from imminent danger or robbery when on private property.
3. This defense cannot be applied in cases of gang on gang violence or in other such instances where the party claiming the defense was put at risk of immediate danger by their own involvement with actionable criminality.
