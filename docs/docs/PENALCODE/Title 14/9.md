# [14.9] Imprisonment & Punishment Criteria

1. Only criminal violations that originate from the Sanctum Penal Code may carry a misdemeanor or felony-level punishment with imprisonment in a county or state penitentiary.
2. All sentences are carried out at the Sanctum State Correctional Facility.
3. Each bullet number (referred to as an element) in a penal code entry refers to an applicable charge for each entry. Violating any one of the descriptions is a violation of the penal code entry.
4. So long as no exceptions are stated in the penal code entry, charges can be stacked for additional imprisonment. See **(14)00**. Exception for details.
5. ((Persons who roleplay without a sound mind will still, in any case, be arrested and charged for the crime they commit. Technically theyâ€™d be delivered to an appropriate institution in-character but are dropped off to the local county or state jail before being sent there. They may and would not be placed with the regular prison population.))
