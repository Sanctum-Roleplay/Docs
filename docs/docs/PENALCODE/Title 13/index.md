# [13] Sentencing Enhancements

## Exception

- Penal code entries, by default, may be modified by Sentencing Enhancements within Title 13. However, should a penal code entry be the exception to a Sentencing Enhancement or contain an exception within its description, then that exception shall be followed instead of the Sentencing Enhancement policy.
- For example, **(1)08**. Murder cannot be charged for an attempt as an entire charge, **(1)06**. Attempted Murder, exists for that purpose.
- Penalties are, as stated, stackable for each occurrence. Committing assault against someone multiple times is worthy of a charge for each time, as long as they are separate police incidents, occur at different time, occur to different people, or are charged for each prohibited object that is possessed. Charges can also be stacked for each person they are committed against. Unless an exception exists explicitly.
- Each stacked charge equals the additional punishment time for that charge. A person who commits two counts of assault will be charged twice the amount of time, so long as it does not violate maximum imprisonment policies.
