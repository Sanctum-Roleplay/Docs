Murder is defined clearly by a person’s premeditated forethought or plan to commit the murder. Manslaughter happens in a heat of passion, by criminal negligence or accident, or for some other incident that is not expected. The only exception to this is when someone commits a planned felony, such as planning to commit an arson. If someone dies as a result of the premeditated arson, it is no longer manslaughter and instead murder. Murder of an “NPC” will be charged as **(1)7**.
