Assault is defined by distance the threats occur. Someone a few feet away threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Criminal Threats is less severe as thereâ€™s a distance that someone can escape through, or that the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat.

Any unwanted physical contact is considered to be battery, however grabbing someone during a threat may be either assault or battery, depending on intention and interpretation.
