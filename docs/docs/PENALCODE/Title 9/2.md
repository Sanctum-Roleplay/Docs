# [9.2] Brandishing A Firearm

- A person who is pointing, holding, openly carrying or brandishing a firearm, air or gas operated weapon, or object that appears like a firearm without proper toy and prop identification in an attempt to elicit fear or hysteria is guilty under this code.
- A person holding an object in a manner similar to a firearm who attempts to elicit the same fear or response as brandishing an actual firearm is guilty under this code.

:::info
Brandishing explicitly notes that the purpose is to elicit fear or hysteria. A Weapons Discharge violation is irrelevant of the intent to elicit hysteria so the two charges can be stacked if appropriate.
