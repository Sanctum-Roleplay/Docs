  - Normal operating plates for civilian or commercial vehicles, including a variety of vanity designs (such as "Importz"), are intended for vehicles owned, operated, leased, rented, or used in a private or commercial non-government capacity.
  - SA Exempt: Exempt plates are issued by the government and are to be displayed on government owned vehicles or private vehicles owned by a government official, which they use to perform both private activities as well as work related functions (requires approval from their employer). The "exemption" means that the government agency does not have to pay vehicle registration fees to the DMV for that vehicle.
  - Protected Plates: Plates which appear as either normal or exempt and display a registration flag of "Protected" or "Restricted" when searched, along with the name of the agency which has protected/restricted that information. These are reserved for higher ranking government officials. These plates are to be treated as SA Exempt plates.
  - Cold-Plated Vehicles: In rare instances, protected plates may be used as completely unregistered for obscurity and security. If a cold-plated vehicle is being driven, the vehicle will appear unregistered, and therefore, the operator of the vehicle should be prepared to verify their employment and explain the vehicle's protected status when questioned about registration. These are reserved for higher ranking government officials. These plates are to be treated as SA Exempt plates.
